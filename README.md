# Formula 1 Circuit Geographic Data

This repository is still in WIP, and it is intended to contain geographical information
about Formula 1 circuits, such as:

- Circuit GeoJSON
- Turns list (with relative and absolute distances, and turn entry geoposition)

## Roadmap

The `circuitId` and the circuit's file name is referring to the `id` used on the [Ergast](http://ergast.com/mrd/) API.

### Step 1

- Turns list with relative and absolute distances.
The layouts taken in account will be from 2022 (for newer layouts), and from 2018 for the rest.

### Step 2

- Add the GeoJSON information for the circuits.
